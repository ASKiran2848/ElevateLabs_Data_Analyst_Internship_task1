📊 Sales Data Cleaning Pipeline
**Overview**

This project preprocesses the Sample Sales Dataset from Kaggle and produces a clean, well-structured CSV file suitable for analysis and reporting.

**What is Data Cleaning**

Data cleaning means fixing or removing incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent data so that the dataset becomes accurate and reliable.
It helps ensure better insights, correct calculations, and error-free analysis.

**Data Cleaning Steps**

Standardized column names for easier handling

Filled missing values (median for numbers, mode for text)

Removed duplicate records

Corrected data types (dates, numbers, text)

Cleaned text fields to maintain uniform formatting

Removed outliers from the sales column to avoid skewed results

Saved the cleaned dataset as sales_data_cleaned.csv

**Output**

A ready-to-use, clean dataset for analytics, dashboards, and ML workflows.
